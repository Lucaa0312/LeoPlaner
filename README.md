# LeoPlaner
The LeoPlaner project is designed to create the perfect timetable for teachers and administrators by utilizing the **simulated annealing** algorithm. We are currently in the starting phase of our 2 year project.

# Planned features
- **Data Management:** adding and managing data such as teachers, rooms, subjects etc.
- **Declaring custom rules:** The user can add rules that will influence the algorithm's behaviour (e.g. specific subjects always being successive)
- **Visual feedback**: Dynamic feedback of the timetable creation
- **Appealing UI/UX**
- **Utilization of an effective algorithm**

# The algorithm
**Simulated annealing** is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. This method allows us to find efficient timetable arrangements that satisfy user-defined constraints.

# Contributions
We welcome contributions from anyone interested, whether it be bug fixes, test cases, or suggestions for improvement. Any effort is greatly appreciated!
