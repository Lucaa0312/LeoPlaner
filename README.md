We are currently in the starting phase of our 2 year project.</b></p>



# Planned features
- **Data Management:** adding and managing data such as teachers, rooms, subjects etc.
- **Declaring custom rules:** The user can add rules that will influence the algorithm's behaviour (e.g. specific subjects always being successive)
- **Visual feedback**: Dynamic feedback of the timetable creation
- **Appealing UI/UX**
- **Utilization of an effective algorithm**

# The algorithm
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bolder"> Simulated annealing</a> is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. This method allows us to find efficient timetable arrangements that satisfy user-defined constraints.

This shows how simulated annealing can be used in hill climbing.

# Contributions
We welcome contributions from anyone interested, whether it be bug fixes, test cases, or suggestions for improvement. Any effort is greatly appreciated!
